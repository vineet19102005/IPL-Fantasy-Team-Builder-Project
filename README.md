This repository stores the ipynb file for the project I have built that helps individual get a team for their IPL fantasy. It is a Optimize and Machine Learning project as I also have built 
a model to predict the amount of point a player will get on a given matchday. 
I have written detailed instructions on how to build a team for upcoming games so make sure read that in the file so that you can build a team yourself.
By the end also predicitions can be done of how many points a player will score. 
For future looking to change the predcition model as well as add new data variables like runs and many more so if you yourself want to update that the stage is all yours.
